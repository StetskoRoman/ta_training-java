No life till leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming it's right, well alright
When we start to rock we never
Want to stop again
 
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
 
We know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way
When we start to rock we never
Want to stop again
 
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
 
With all our screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It's causing you sweet pain, oh sweet pain
When we start to rock we never
Want to stop again
 
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
